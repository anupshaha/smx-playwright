# smx-playwright


## Please Note:
    1. This Framework is designed with basic functionalities just for demo and POC purpose
    2. Tests suites needs to be revisited and E2E Workflows needs to be designed as per requirements
    3. Standardized naming convention, data parameterization changes will be needed
    4. Extra Utility Files (APIActions.ts, WebActions.ts and Wrapper.ts) are added just for future reference. In basic POC, these files are not used.

### playwright/test installation:
    npm install @playwright/test
